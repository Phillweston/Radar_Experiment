# Radar Experiment

## First Directory

The `First` directory contains MATLAB scripts and a Jupyter Notebook focused on basic radar equations and solutions, including:

### MATLAB 1

- Dual base requirement solutions (`dual_base_req_solution.m`)
- High and low pulse repetition frequency solutions (`hprf_req_solution.m`, `lprf_req_solution.m`)
- Power-aperture product solutions (`power_aperture_solution.m`)
- Direct look and radar equation solutions (`radar_direct_look_solution.m`, `radar_eq_solution.m`)
- Radial velocity and wavelength solutions (`radial_velocity_and_wavelength_solution.m`)

### Jupyter Notebook 1

- Radar simulation (`Radar_Simulation_1.ipynb`)

## Second Directory

The `Second` directory includes MATLAB scripts and a Jupyter Notebook for advanced radar signal processing techniques, such as:

### MATLAB 2

- Ambiguity function solutions for various waveforms (`af_barker_solution.m`, `af_gauss_solution.m`, `af_lfm_solution.m`, `af_sp_solution.m`)
- Improvement factor calculation (`improv_fac.m`)
- Linear frequency modulation compression (`lfm_comp_solution.m`)
- Marcum Q-function solution (`marcumsq_solution.m`)
- Optimal detection characteristics for signals with Rayleigh fading (`optimal_detection_characteristics_for_signals_with_rayleigh_fading.m`)
- PCM compression solution (`pcm_comp_solution.m`)
- Stretch processing of LFM signals (`stretch_lfm_solution.m`)

### Jupyter Notebook 2

- Radar simulation with advanced scenarios (`Radar_Simulation_2.ipynb`)

## Getting Started

To use these scripts and notebooks, ensure you have MATLAB installed for the `.m` files and Jupyter Notebook for the `.ipynb` files. Each script is standalone and can be run independently to simulate or analyze specific radar processing techniques.
